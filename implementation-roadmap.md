# Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1 - Dev and Observability Overhaul
- **Local Development**: Establish containerized dev environment with Docker and Docker Compose
- **Instrumentation**: Build custom monitoring for database connections and memory usage patterns
- **Observability Stack**: Implement comprehensive logging, distributed tracing, and real-time dashboards
- **Connection Stability**: Monitor and mitigate Supabase connection drops with resilient connection handling

## Phase 2 - AWS Migration
- **Database Upgrade**: Test and migrate to AWS RDS Aurora for improved reliability and scalability
- **Infrastructure Migration**: Deploy components to purpose-built AWS services:
  - Database: AWS RDS Aurora PostgreSQL
  - API Server: AWS App Runner for Bun applications
  - Job Processing: AWS Batch for background workloads
  - Frontend: AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN for Next.js assets
- **Zero-Downtime Strategy**: Implement Liquibase for seamless database migrations
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Establish robust release and rollback strategies with transactional deployments

## Phase 3 - SOC2 Compliance
- **Security Framework**: Implement core SOC2 controls and compliance requirements
- **Compliance Automation**: Leverage AWS Security Hub to track and validate compliance work
- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive security policies and procedures

## Phase 4 - Architecture Review
- **Scaling Assessment**: Evaluate current architecture against growth projections
- **Container Orchestration**: Review App Runner solution against EKS capabilities
- **Migration Decision**: Implement EKS migration if justified by scaling needs and operational benefits
