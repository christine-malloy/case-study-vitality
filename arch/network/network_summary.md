# Vitality Network Architecture Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the Vitality network infrastructure configured with Terraform.

## Overview

The Vitality network architecture is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and highly available infrastructure for deploying cloud applications. It follows AWS best practices for network segmentation, security, and access control.

## Key Components

- **VPC**: A dedicated Virtual Private Cloud with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
- **Subnet Structure**:
  - Public/Private subnet pairs in us-east-1a and us-east-1b
  - Private-only subnets in us-east-1c and us-east-1d
- **Access Control**:
  - Bastion host for secure SSH access to resources
  - Security groups for fine-grained traffic control
- **Security**:
  - Dedicated PostgreSQL security group for database access
  - Restricted network paths for sensitive services

## Diagram

For a detailed UML diagram and comprehensive documentation of the network infrastructure, see the [Network Architecture Documentation](./).

## Benefits

- **Security**: Layered security approach with bastion host and security groups
- **Scalability**: Multiple availability zones for high availability
- **Isolation**: Clear separation between public and private resources
- **Maintainability**: Infrastructure as Code using Terraform for reproducible deployments
- **Compliance-Ready**: Network design follows security best practices

## Next Steps

- Integrate with other infrastructure components (db, registry)
- Configure additional security measures (VPC endpoints, NACLs)
- Set up monitoring and logging for network traffic
- Implement automated testing for network configuration
