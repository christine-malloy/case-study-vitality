# Vitality Registry Architecture Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the container registry infrastructure for the Vitality project.

## Overview

The Vitality project uses Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to store and manage Docker container images. This managed service provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for our application containers.

## Key Components

- **ECR Repository**: Private Docker repository named `vitality-dev-app`
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automated rules that manage image retention and cleanup
- **Access Control**: IAM-based permissions for secure image pushing and pulling
- **Integration Points**: CI/CD pipelines and deployment environments

## Diagram

For a detailed diagram and comprehensive documentation of the registry infrastructure, see the [Registry Architecture Documentation](./).

## Benefits

- **Security**: IAM authentication, encryption at rest, and vulnerability scanning
- **Performance**: Fast image pulling with regional replication capabilities
- **Reliability**: Fully managed service with high availability
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for storage used with automated cleanup policies
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple repositories as the application grows

## Next Steps

- Implement advanced lifecycle policies for image management
- Configure cross-region replication for global deployments
- Set up automated vulnerability scanning for container images
- Create dedicated repositories for different application components
