# Vitality Database Architecture Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the database infrastructure for the Vitality project.

## Overview

The Vitality project uses Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL for its database needs. This managed service provides a high-performance, scalable, and highly available database solution that is compatible with PostgreSQL.

## Key Components

- **Aurora PostgreSQL Cluster**: Single-node writer configuration (dev environment)
- **Instance Type**: db.r6g.large (ARM-based) for cost-effective performance
- **Network Isolation**: Deployed in private subnets with security group restrictions
- **Database Configuration**: PostgreSQL 16 compatibility, port 5432

## Diagram

## Benefits

- **Performance**: Aurora provides better performance than standard PostgreSQL
- **Security**: Network isolation, access controls, and encryption at rest and in transit
- **Reliability**: Automatic backups, multi-AZ storage, and failover capability
- **Manageability**: Fully managed service reduces operational overhead
- **Scalability**: Ability to add read replicas and scale vertically as needed

## Next Steps

- Add read replicas for production workloads
- Implement IAM authentication for better security
- Set up automated maintenance and monitoring
- Implement disaster recovery procedures
- Deploy cross-region replicas for global resilience
