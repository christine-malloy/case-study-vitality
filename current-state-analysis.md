# Current State Analysis

Our startup faces several critical challenges that require immediate attention:

## Infrastructure & Performance Issues
- **Memory Leaks**: Servers regularly crash due to unchecked memory usage, currently mitigated by a cron job restarting them every 2 hours to avoid high infrastructure costs.
- **Database Connectivity**: Our database frequently drops connections, significantly impacting system reliability. A more robust hosting solution is needed.
- **Kubernetes Uncertainty**: Questions remain about whether and when to adopt Kubernetes as our orchestration platform.

## Development & Operations
- **Poor Observability**: Limited visibility into system errors, tool sprawl across monitoring platforms, and no proactive error detection mechanisms.
- **Rollback Strategies**: Our CI/CD pipeline lacks robust rollback mechanisms for failed migrations or deployments across microservices.
- **Zero-Downtime Migrations**: Current migration processes are lengthy and risk user-facing errors during updates.
- **Shared Development Environment**: Six engineers currently share a single database, creating significant risk of conflicts and development bottlenecks.

## Compliance & Documentation
- **SOC2 Compliance**: Required for our business operations but not yet implemented.
- **Architecture Documentation**: System architecture diagram needs updating to accurately represent the current state.
