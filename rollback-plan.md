# Rollback Plan

In today’s microservices landscape, a robust rollback plan is essential for maintaining system stability and ensuring a seamless user experience, especially when deploying updates across distributed services. Since you’re not using Kubernetes, this plan focuses on feature flagging and tools designed for atomic deployments in a non-Kubernetes environment, while briefly mentioning Argo Rollouts for context. Below is a comprehensive rollback strategy tailored to your modern microservices-based system.

## Rollback Plan our Case Study

### 1. **Feature Flagging for Controlled Rollbacks**
   - **Purpose**: Feature flags allow you to enable or disable features dynamically without redeploying code, making them a cornerstone of quick and safe rollbacks.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Adopt a feature flag management tool such as **LaunchDarkly**, **Flagsmith**, or **Unleash** to control feature releases across your microservices.
     - Encapsulate new or updated features within flags, enabling you to toggle them on or off as needed.
   - **Rollback Process**:
     - If a deployed feature introduces issues, disable it by toggling the flag off, instantly reverting to the previous behavior without altering the codebase.
     - Use the analytics provided by your feature flag tool to monitor the impact of flag changes and validate the rollback’s success.

### 2. **Atomic Deployments Across Distributed Microservices**
   - **Purpose**: Atomic deployments ensure all microservices are updated simultaneously, preventing version mismatches and partial failures that complicate rollbacks.
   - **Tools and Frameworks**:
     - **Spinnaker**: A multi-cloud continuous delivery platform that excels at atomic deployments and rollbacks. It orchestrates deployments across environments like AWS or GCP, ensuring all services update in a coordinated manner.
     - **AWS CodeDeploy**: If your microservices run on AWS, CodeDeploy supports atomic deployments and can automatically roll back if health checks fail.
   - **Argo Rollouts (Kubernetes Context)**:
     - Note that in the case of Kubernetes, **Argo Rollouts** would be an excellent choice for managing atomic deployments and rollbacks based on metrics. We are planning to use a different compute solution to start however.

### 3. **Deployment Strategies for Safe Rollbacks**
   - **Blue-Green Deployment**:
     - **Approach**: Maintain two identical environments: "Blue" (current production) and "Green" (new version). Deploy updates to Green, test it, and switch traffic from Blue to Green. If issues arise, revert traffic to Blue.
     - **Benefits**: Provides an instant rollback option by keeping the previous environment fully operational.
     - **Tooling**: Spinnaker and AWS CodeDeploy both support blue-green deployments natively.
   - **Canary Releases**:
     - **Approach**: Roll out changes gradually to a small subset of users or services. Monitor the canary group, and if problems occur, redirect traffic back to the stable version.
     - **Benefits**: Limits the blast radius of issues, making rollbacks less disruptive.
     - **Tooling**: Use feature flagging tools like LaunchDarkly to control the percentage of users exposed to the new version.

### 4. **Monitoring and Observability for Quick Detection**
   - **Purpose**: Early detection of issues enables proactive rollbacks before they affect all users.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Deploy **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to monitor service health, performance metrics, and error rates in real time.
     - Configure alerts for anomalies (e.g., increased latency or error spikes) to trigger manual or automated rollbacks.
     - Use **ELK Stack** or **Datadog** for log aggregation and analysis to pinpoint root causes during a rollback scenario.

### 5. **Database Migrations and Rollbacks**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure database changes are reversible to maintain data integrity during rollbacks.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Use **Flyway** or **Liquibase** to manage database schema migrations with version control.
     - Design migrations to be backward compatible or include explicit rollback scripts.
   - **Rollback Process**:
     - If a deployment fails, execute the rollback script to revert the database to its previous schema, ensuring consistency with the rolled-back services.

### 6. **Versioning and Compatibility**
   - **Purpose**: Track service versions to manage compatibility and simplify rollbacks.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Apply **semantic versioning** (e.g., v1.2.3) to each microservice to clearly indicate changes and dependencies.
     - Ensure APIs remain backward compatible where feasible, reducing the risk of rollback-related failures.

### 7. **Automated Testing in CI/CD Pipelines**
   - **Purpose**: Prevent faulty deployments that require rollbacks by catching issues early.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Integrate automated unit, integration, and smoke tests into your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI).
     - Run pre-deployment health checks to confirm service stability before going live.
   - **Rollback Trigger**:
     - If tests or checks fail during deployment, automatically revert to the previous stable version.

### 8. **Documentation and Team Responsibilities**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure the rollback process is well-understood and executable by the team.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Document detailed rollback procedures for each service, including manual steps if required.
     - Assign rollback duties to specific team members or on-call engineers.
     - Conduct periodic rollback drills to validate the process and train the team.

## Summary of the Rollback Plan
- **Feature Flagging**: Use LaunchDarkly or Flagsmith to toggle features for instant, code-free rollbacks.
- **Atomic Deployments**: Leverage Spinnaker or AWS CodeDeploy to update all services simultaneously.
- **Deployment Strategies**: Implement blue-green or canary releases for reversible updates.
- **Monitoring**: Employ Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to detect issues and initiate rollbacks.
- **Database Migrations**: Manage schema changes with Flyway or Liquibase, including rollback scripts.
- **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning to track changes and ensure compatibility.
- **Automated Testing**: Embed tests in CI/CD pipelines to minimize deployment failures.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear rollback instructions and practice the process regularly.

This plan equips your microservices system with the tools and strategies needed to deploy updates confidently and roll back efficiently, minimizing downtime and user impact in a modern, non-Kubernetes environment.
