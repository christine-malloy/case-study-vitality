# Memory Leak Issues

## Problem Statement

Our application is experiencing critical memory leak issues that are causing servers to crash regularly. Currently, we're mitigating this by implementing a cron job that restarts the servers every 2 hours to prevent complete system failure and avoid excessive cloud computing costs.

### Symptoms and Impact

- Servers show steadily increasing memory usage over time, regardless of traffic load
- After approximately 2-3 hours of uptime, memory consumption reaches critical levels
- Application performance degrades significantly as memory usage increases
- Eventually, servers crash with out-of-memory errors
- Users experience intermittent service disruptions during server restarts
- Engineering team spends significant time troubleshooting instead of building features
- Cloud computing costs are higher than necessary due to inefficient resource usage

### Potential Causes

1. **Unclosed Database Connections**: The application may not be properly closing database connections, especially during error conditions or when connections drop unexpectedly.

2. **Event Listener Accumulation**: Event listeners might be added repeatedly without being removed, causing memory leaks over time.

3. **Circular References**: Objects referencing each other in ways that prevent garbage collection from reclaiming memory.

4. **Large Object Caching**: Improper caching of large objects or datasets without size limits or expiration policies.

5. **Memory-Intensive Operations**: Operations that consume large amounts of memory without proper cleanup, particularly in data processing workflows.

6. **Third-Party Library Issues**: Memory leaks in dependencies or improper usage of third-party libraries.

### Current Mitigation

Our temporary solution involves a cron job that automatically restarts the servers every 2 hours. While this prevents complete system failure, it's clearly not a sustainable approach and introduces several problems:

- Brief service interruptions during restarts
- Loss of in-memory application state
- Inability to maintain long-running processes
- Engineering resources diverted to maintaining workarounds
- Masking of the underlying issues rather than resolving them

A proper solution requires identifying and addressing the root causes of these memory leaks rather than continuing with the current restart approach.

## Mitigation Strategies

To prevent these issues, we consider implementing the following strategies:

### Cache Size Limits
Implement policies to limit the size of the cache. This can involve setting a maximum cache size and employing eviction strategies (e.g., least recently used) to remove old or less frequently accessed data when the limit is reached.

### Data Compression
Compressing cached data can reduce memory usage, allowing more data to be stored within the same memory constraints.

### Efficient Data Structures
Utilize memory-efficient data structures to store cached data, minimizing overhead and reducing the overall memory footprint.

### Regular Monitoring
Implement monitoring to track memory usage over time. This can help identify potential memory leaks or excessive memory consumption early, allowing for timely intervention.

### Garbage Collection
Ensure that any resources allocated for caching are properly released when no longer needed, facilitating effective garbage collection and preventing memory leaks.

## Local Dev Solution

## Local Dev Solution

A robust local development environment is crucial for identifying and resolving memory leak issues before they impact production. Our [local dev stack](./local-dev-stack.md) approach provides several key advantages:

### Memory Profiling and Debugging

- **Isolated Environment**: Developers can use Docker containers that mirror production configurations to reproduce memory leaks in isolation without affecting shared resources.
- **Profiling Tools Integration**: Local environments can be configured with memory profiling tools like `node --inspect` for Node.js applications or Bun's built-in performance analysis tools.
- **Heap Snapshots**: Developers can take memory heap snapshots at different intervals to identify objects that aren't being properly garbage collected.

### Controlled Testing Scenarios

- **Load Testing**: Engineers can simulate high traffic scenarios locally to observe memory growth patterns without risking production stability.
- **Long-Running Tests**: Tests can be designed to run for extended periods in the local environment to surface memory leaks that only appear over time.
- **Reproducible Test Cases**: Create specific test scenarios that trigger suspected memory leak conditions for targeted debugging.

### Immediate Feedback Loop

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Local monitoring dashboards can provide immediate feedback on memory usage during development.
- **Quick Iteration**: Developers can implement fixes and immediately verify their effectiveness without waiting for deployment cycles.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Before/after memory usage comparisons can validate that fixes actually resolve the underlying issues.

By leveraging our Docker-based local development stack, engineers can proactively identify, debug, and fix memory leaks during the development process rather than discovering them in production. This approach shifts memory management from a reactive emergency response to a proactive engineering practice, ultimately reducing server crashes, eliminating the need for scheduled restarts, and improving overall system stability.

## Conclusion

Memory leaks represent a significant operational challenge currently addressed through unsustainable workarounds. By implementing proper monitoring, cache constraints, and leveraging our local development environment for diagnosis, we can address these issues at their source. This approach will improve system stability, reduce operational overhead, and free our engineering team to focus on delivering value rather than maintaining temporary fixes.
