Diagnosing dropped database connections in a multi-layered architecture like this requires a systematic, multi-step approach. Here’s a breakdown of how you might proceed:

Examine Logs and Metrics:

Database Logs: Start by reviewing PostgreSQL logs (or your database provider’s logs) to check for connection timeouts, rejections, or errors indicating resource exhaustion.
Application Logs: Look at logs from the sync engine (Zero), the TRPC API, and the Redis layer. These logs may show error patterns (e.g., “connection closed” or “timeout reached”) that point to specific failure points.
Monitoring Tools: Use monitoring solutions (such as Prometheus, Grafana, or your cloud provider’s monitoring tools) to gather metrics on connection counts, query latency, and error rates.
Check Connection Pool Settings:

Ensure that your application or sync engine isn’t exhausting the database connection pool. Misconfigured maximum connection limits or long-running queries can lead to pool depletion, causing dropped connections.
Network and Infrastructure:

Network Reliability: Investigate if there are any intermittent network issues between your application servers and your Postgres instance. This might involve checking firewall settings, load balancers, or any VPN configurations.
Infrastructure Health: Verify that the infrastructure hosting your database (whether it’s self‑hosted or managed by a provider) is not under heavy load, which can lead to dropped connections.
Review Timeouts and Retries:

Timeout Settings: Double-check the timeout settings on both the client and server sides. If the sync engine or TRPC API has aggressive timeout configurations, this could lead to premature termination of connections.
Retry Mechanisms: Make sure there are proper retry strategies in place for transient network issues or temporary connection failures.
Evaluate the Role of Intermediate Layers:

Sync Engine (Zero): Since Zero sits between your application and the database, review its configuration for how it manages persistent connections. Check if it’s properly handling reconnections or if it’s inadvertently causing connection drops during sync operations.
Redis Caching Layer: Although Redis is used for caching, ensure that any cache invalidation or update operations that involve the database aren’t overwhelming your DB with concurrent requests.
Isolate and Reproduce:

Try to reproduce the connection drops in a controlled environment by simulating load and monitoring which component fails first. This isolation can help pinpoint whether the issue is with the database, the sync engine, or a network segment.
Configuration Audits:

Database Configuration: Review PostgreSQL’s configuration (e.g., max_connections, work_mem, shared_buffers) to ensure it’s tuned for your workload.
Application Configuration: Confirm that your application’s connection strings and pool settings are optimized for your traffic patterns.
