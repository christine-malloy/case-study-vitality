# Database Connection Issues

This stands out as one of the top issues in this case study. The system experiences regular dropped database connections, leading to feature degradation and outages. We want to investigate further and develop a plan to remediate. Our strategy is going to focus on two facets: implementing active observability tooling in application code to track dropped connections, and migrating to [AWS Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), a scalable and production capable database platform. The intent of this strategy is to focus on immediate control and resolution, followed by long term stability and scalability.

## Observability Strategy
- **Database Logs**: Start by reviewing PostgreSQL logs (or your database provider's logs) to check for connection timeouts, rejections, or errors indicating resource exhaustion.
- **Application Logs**: Look at logs from the sync engine (Zero), the TRPC API, and the Redis layer. These logs may show error patterns (e.g., "connection closed" or "timeout reached") that point to specific failure points.
- **Central Log Sink**: Pipe to log sink and build automations/alerts to trigger off of relevant error/warning logs.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use monitoring solutions to gather metrics on connection counts, query latency, and error rates.

## Check Connection Pool Settings

- **Pool Management**: Ensure that your application or sync engine isn't exhausting the database connection pool. Misconfigured maximum connection limits or long-running queries can lead to pool depletion, causing dropped connections.
- **Monitoring Controls**: Deploy relevant monitoring controls and add scaling automations based on open connections.

## Network and Infrastructure

- **Network Reliability**: Investigate if there are any intermittent network issues between your application servers and your Postgres instance. This might involve checking firewall settings, load balancers, or any VPN configurations.
- **Infrastructure Health**: Verify that the infrastructure hosting your database (whether it's self‑hosted or managed by a provider) is not under heavy load, which can lead to dropped connections.

## Review Timeouts and Retries

- **Timeout Settings**: Double-check the timeout settings on both the client and server sides. If the sync engine or TRPC API has aggressive timeout configurations, this could lead to premature termination of connections.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Make sure there are proper retry strategies in place for transient network issues or temporary connection failures. Handle this on the application/sync-engine layer.

## Evaluate the Role of Intermediate Layers

- **Sync Engine (Zero)**: Since Zero sits between the application and the database, review its configuration for how it manages persistent connections. Check if it's properly handling reconnections or if it's inadvertently causing connection drops during sync operations.
- **Redis Caching Layer**: Although Redis is used for caching, ensure that any cache invalidation or update operations that involve the database aren't overwhelming your DB with concurrent requests. Unlikely since we are only using it for light caching.

Isolate and Reproduce:
- Try to reproduce the connection drops in a controlled environment by simulating load and monitoring which component fails first. This isolation can help pinpoint whether the issue is with the database, the sync engine, or a network segment.
- Use [local dev stack](./local-dev-stack.md) as foundation for controlled environment testing

Configuration Audits:
- Database Configuration: Review PostgreSQL’s configuration (e.g., max_connections, work_mem, shared_buffers) to ensure it’s tuned for your workload.
- Application Configuration: Confirm that your application’s connection strings and pool settings are optimized for your traffic patterns.
