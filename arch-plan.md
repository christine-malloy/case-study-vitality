# Vitality Architecture - High Level Overview

## Architecture Components

The Vitality platform is built on a modern, secure, and scalable cloud-native architecture leveraging AWS services to provide a reliable foundation for our business operations.

## Database Solution: Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL

Aurora PostgreSQL serves as our primary database solution, offering:

- **High Performance**: 3x throughput of standard PostgreSQL with minimal latency
- **Reliability**: Six-way replication across three availability zones with automated backups
- **Scalability**: Ability to scale compute and storage independently based on demand
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model with ability to scale down during low-usage periods
- **Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit with granular access controls

Our current implementation uses a single writer node configuration with plans to add read replicas as the application scales.

## Observability Platform: AWS CloudWatch

AWS CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring and observability capabilities:

- **Unified Monitoring**: Centralized visibility into all AWS resources, applications, and services
- **Metrics Collection**: Automatic collection of key performance metrics across infrastructure
- **Logging**: Aggregation and analysis of logs from all application components
- **Alarms**: Proactive notifications based on predefined thresholds
- **Dashboards**: Custom visualization of operational health and business metrics
- **Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing for performance optimization

Our observability strategy includes detailed monitoring of API performance, database queries, and frontend user experience metrics.

## Security & Compliance: AWS Security Hub

To support our upcoming SOC2 compliance efforts, AWS Security Hub provides:

- **Compliance Checks**: Automated security checks against industry standards including SOC2
- **Unified Security View**: Centralized dashboard for security findings across AWS accounts
- **Automated Remediation**: Integration with AWS Config for automated remediation of non-compliant resources
- **Continuous Assessment**: Ongoing evaluation of security posture with regular reporting
- **Integration**: Connection to third-party security tools for comprehensive coverage
- **Audit Trail**: Detailed logging of security events for compliance documentation

Our security implementation includes least-privilege IAM policies, network isolation through VPC design, encryption of data at rest and in transit, and regular security assessments.

## Implementation Resources

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Our infrastructure is managed entirely through Terraform, with configuration files organized by component:

- **Network:** [infra/network/](./infra/network/) - VPC, subnets, and security groups
- **Database:** [infra/db/](./infra/db/) - Aurora PostgreSQL cluster configuration
- **Container Registry:** [infra/registry/](./infra/registry/) - Amazon ECR for Docker images
- **API Service:** [infra/api/](./infra/api/) - AWS App Runner service for the backend
- **Frontend:** [infra/frontend/](./infra/frontend/) - S3, CloudFront, and WAF for the web application

### Architecture Documentation

Detailed architecture documents are available for each component:

- **Network Architecture:** [arch/network/](./arch/network/)
- **Database Architecture:** [arch/db/](./arch/db/)
- **Container Registry Architecture:** [arch/registry/](./arch/registry/)
- **API Architecture:** [arch/api/](./arch/api/)
- **Frontend Architecture:** [arch/frontend/](./arch/frontend/)

## Next Steps

- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for production workloads
- Deploy read replicas for the Aurora cluster to improve read scalability
- Complete Security Hub integration and run initial compliance assessment
- Establish regular security review cadence aligned with SOC2 requirements
